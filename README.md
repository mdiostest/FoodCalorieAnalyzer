- MVVM architecture
- Core Data integration for local storage

## Requirements
- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.0+
- OpenAI API Key
- Cursor IDE
- SweetPad VS Code extension

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `FoodCalorieAnalyzer.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Add your OpenAI API key in `Config.swift`
4. Build and run the project
